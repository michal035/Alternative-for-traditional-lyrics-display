# Lyrics Display Project

**Note: This project is still under development!**

The goal of this project is to create a platform that allows users to create and share instances of lyrics display. The project is built using Python Django for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database, and Vue JS for the frontend. Keep in mind this is a backend project - do not focus on the frontend.
